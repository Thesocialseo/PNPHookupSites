It has a slightly smaller reach than letshangout, but much like the former, it is a promising upstart that tends to draw a lot of our people. Who knows?

You can search for various chat groups based on keywords, and odds are you won&#39;t have much trouble finding a PNP Hookup &nbsp;group dedicated to your location or a nearby location. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.4airi3v5u77g"><span class="c3">PNP Friendly Social Networks:</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So the big guys are out of the question for a number of reasons, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and now Tumblr&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are plenty of others that are PNP friendly and have a lot of us on there, and are definitely a lot of fun to frequent and view and share pnp related content, such as (the biggies Twitter and Reddit) as well as the upstarts NewTumbl.com BDSMLR.com Youllo.net Sharesome.com and swarmr.com - and they would most definitely be my list of selections for this category IF they offered the ability to search for people based on location or distance. Sadly, that is not the purpose of those particular sites nor do they offer that functionality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, there are a few that do:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://fetlife.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1591607867743000">FetLife.com</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is an excellent source whether you be gay straight or bi and have a Kinky streak. They offer searchable user profiles, Classified ads, groups (essentially forum posting), private messaging between users, and the ability to share media such as pictures and video, they also have the Shoutbox, which allows you to see everything people post in their Shoutbox in real time whether you are connected them or not although that has no geographic filtering, just a fun feature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another social network that has been garnering a ton of pnp fandom is Mewe. For the uninitiated, me.we is what is referred to as a decentralized social network where free speech prevails. Somewhat like what Mastodon is, but more feature-rich, less confusing and more popular. How you go about finding your communities is you can do a search for groups, and search for PNP, party, etc (we know our keywords) and join groups that way. A lot of our people have our chat groups set to private though meaning only invited people can see them even in search. The trick to getting into those is this:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Do a search for users using the same tactic you just used to search for groups. Send friend requests out to everyone with a screen name of that sounds like a fit for our goals and has a profile picture. Make sure you post something cool or funny or sexy and have a profile picture yourself. Ask them for invitations to groups. DONE.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Huge amounts of daily users and huge potential for local hookups whether you are gay straight or bi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.60xv4bqnnkb"><span class="c3">PNP Friendly Hookup Apps:</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So you probably won&#39;t be finding much PNP action on OkCupid or Baidoo&hellip; but luckily, those are not the only options.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Depending on your sexual orientation here are some apps available on both Android and iOS that will almost guarantee success:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.pw3wuux2da72"><span class="c10">For Gay or Bisexual men (or the &quot;curious&quot; or &quot;so high they don&#39;t care who does them&quot;) there is:</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adam4Adam - one of the oldest hookup apps out there for gay man, if not the oldest with an app, is Adam4Adam. This is one that used to be at one point the largest hook-up site and app, however the gays are a fickle bunch and like to constantly pursued the newest and next thing so it is lost considerable popularity. That being said, I list this is my first choice because it does have enough usage in most areas to get the job done and, unlike all the other apps, it actually lists &quot;PNP&quot; as one of the options in your profile under &quot;looking for&quot; AND allows you to search specifically for &quot;looking for: PNP&quot; and sort by distance!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Grindr - although not everybody on their is party-friendly, and grinder has cracked down on certain things such as what words or emojis can be used, luckily our terminology is forever changing and forever updating, so you shouldn&#39;t have too much trouble conveying your wants on your anonymous profile or screen name and there are typically plenty of men in the area looking for pnp now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h4 class="c9" id="h.7o5jhmog2pzs"><span class="c10">For Straight PNP People there is:</span></h4><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whisper, although it is not specifically for PNP people, this completely anonymous app enables you to get in contact with like-minded individuals through what are called &quot;whispers&quot;... You can reply to whispers that other users posted either by direct private message or with a whisper that is shown publicly in response to their whisper, same concept as a comment on a Facebook share or a Reddit post or tweet, but in the whisper format which is easier to grasp by actually seeing it as opposed to me explaining it. You can locate these whispers either with their default method which is all whispers near you sorted by distance, and you can also join groups based on specific interest and/or localities which serve as a more anonymous, per capita more naughty, and more locations centric version of subreddits with whispers as the post format </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In addition to whisper, both of the social networks listed in the previous section can </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">very easily be considered numbers 2 and 3 for this category.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Me.we, out of the two, is the more trendy one which has it&#39;s app posted both on Google Play and the Apple app store. It&#39;s app is also much more robust and user-friendly the functionality is 100% there to the point where I had been using it for a month, built up a following of over 1500, become a member of posted in it and even created a few groups before I even realized that there was a desktop version!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">FetLife is another one that if you are both a partier and a kinkster, which most of us tend to be, will very much appeal to you. Their app is not available in either the Google Play store or the Apple app store, largely because they make no qualms about exactly what the site is about and what it&#39;s for and what they represent which is commendable. Luckily, their extreme popularity makes it to where it does not hurt them at all to have their mobile app only available for download directly from their site. Their mobile app is nowhere near as functional as mewe, but it certainly gets the job done and will definitely send you the notifications you need when you receive messages from party people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.50dx1romqikn"><span class="c3">Classified Ads / Personals:</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With Craigslist personals and Backpage out of the picture and doublelist being double douchey, are options in this regard are not as great as they used to be, but some do exist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One place where we can find such listings would be casualx this site also has an app on Google Play and the Apple app store, it is somewhat of in between Craigslist ads and one of the more robust apps for hookups.

There is a reason why a lot of these sites will come to you to create a profile. It enables you to not only be seen when you post or comment on videos that come up in your search, it also in the cases of the following, enables you to search for other members and chat with them as well based on specific search queries, along with gender and sexual orientation or preference, age etc. And if they have filled out their profile completely and dropped one or two of our keywords somewhere in the profile either in this screen name or in the content of the profile you should have no trouble finding them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>That said, you can sort by distance.
